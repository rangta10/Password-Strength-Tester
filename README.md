Password-Strength-Tester

A Python utility that analyzes a password’s strength using regex-based criteria and assigns a score from 0-100, then classifies it as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.

🔍 Features

Evaluates password length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols) and other patterns to assess strength.

Gives a numeric score (0-100) plus a qualitative grade (Weak/Moderate/Strong).

Simple CLI (command-line) interface to quickly test passwords.

Written in Python using the re library for regex checks.

Lightweight and easy to integrate or extend for other tools.

🧰 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.

(Optional) A virtual environment recommended for isolating dependencies.

Installation
git clone https://github.com/rangta10/Password-Strength-Tester.git  
cd Password-Strength-Tester  
# (Optional) Create and activate venv  
# python3 -m venv venv  
# source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you have any dependencies listed  

Usage

Run the utility via command-line, for example:

python password_strength_tester.py  


You will be prompted to enter a password, after which you’ll receive a score and classification.
You can also import the module into your own script if you want to integrate its functionality.

🎯 How It Works

Checks minimum and maximum length criteria.

Uses regex checks to detect presence of:

Lowercase letters

Uppercase letters

Digits

Symbols/special characters

Penalises for common weaknesses (for example: no diversity, repeated characters, easily guessable patterns).

Aggregates results into a single numeric score (0-100).

Maps the score to a grade:

Weak (0-40)

Moderate (41-70)

Strong (71-100)

✅ Example
Enter a password: MyP@ssw0rd123  
Score: 78  
Classification: Strong  

📝 Why Use This Tool?

Quickly gauge how secure a password is from a diversity standpoint.

Can be used in scripts or applications to enforce stronger password policies.

Learn how simple regex-based checks can form part of a password-hardening strategy.

🛠 Extending & Customising

You may wish to:

Adjust scoring thresholds (e.g., what constitutes “Strong”).

Add checks for dictionary words or leaked passwords.

Integrate via a GUI or web interface.

Provide batch-mode support (test many passwords at once).

Log or export results for audit/tracking purposes.
